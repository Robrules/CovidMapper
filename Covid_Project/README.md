# COVID Mapper

A web app that visualises COVIDâ€‘19 risk by NSW Local Government Area (LGA), lets you bookmark locations and stay informed via an interactive Mapbox map.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Real-time data** from the NSW Health API (case counts & vaccination rates)  
- **Risk engine** (`determineRisk()`) assigns colourâ€‘coded risk levels per LGA  
- **Interactive map** with Mapbox geocoder search and LGA boundary layers  
- **User accounts** (Django auth): registration, email confirmation, login/logout  
- **Bookmarking**: create lists of LGAs you want to monitor  
- **Offline cache** via SQLite (optional)
